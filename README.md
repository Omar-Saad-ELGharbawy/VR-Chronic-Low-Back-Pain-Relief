# VR Chronic Low Back Pain Relief Project

Welcome to the VR Chronic Low Back Pain Relief Project! This innovative virtual reality application is designed to alleviate chronic low back pain using pose estimation technology. Inspired by the research paper "Embodiment in Virtual Reality for the Treatment of Chronic Low Back Pain: A Case Series," our project focuses on balancing a table with a ball above it. The user's goal is to maintain balance to prevent the ball from falling to the ground, engaging their core muscles and promoting a healthier posture.

## Features

- **Pose Estimation:**
  - Utilizes advanced pose estimation algorithms to track the user's body movements in real-time.

- **Balancing Table Game:**
  - Engage in a virtual game where you balance a table with a ball above it by adjusting your body posture.

- **Avatar Mimicry:**
  - An avatar mirrors the user's movements, providing visual feedback and enhancing the sense of embodiment.

- **Timer and Progress Tracking:**
  - A timer calculates how long the user successfully balances the virtual table, allowing for progress tracking over time.

- **Immersive VR Environment:**
  - Enjoy a visually appealing and immersive virtual environment designed to enhance the overall experience.
